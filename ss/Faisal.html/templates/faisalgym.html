                    <p class="detail">
                        Cardio, short for cardiovascular exercise, is any activity that raises your heart
                    rate and improves the efficiency of your heart, lungs, and circulatory system. Activities like
                    running, swimming, cycling, and brisk walking fall into this category. Cardio helps burn calories,
                    aids in weight management, and boosts overall energy levels. It’s also crucial for reducing the risk
                    of heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Regular cardio enhances endurance, strengthens your
                    heart, and improves mental well-being by releasing endorphins. Whether high-intensity or moderate,
                    incorporating cardio into your routine promotes a healthier, more active lifestyle and supports
                    long-term physical and mental health</p>

                    <p class="detail">Strength training is essential for building muscle, improving bone health , and
                        increasing overall physical endurance. Whether you're aiming to lift heavier weights, run faster, or
                        simply improve your body’s functionality, strength exercises provide the foundation for it all.
                        Through consistent training, you can enhance your metabolism, prevent injuries, and maintain a
                        healthy body composition. Strength training also boosts confidence by helping you achieve personal
                        goals, while simultaneously increasing mental resilience. Additionally, it promotes longevity by
                        keeping your muscles, tendons, and ligaments strong, which is especially important as we age.
                        Incorporating strength exercises into your routine can transform both your body and mind

                    <p class="detail">Boxing is a dynamic and intense sport that requires strength, agility, and
                        mental
                        focus. It involves both physical and strategic skills, as athletes must master footwork,
                        punches,
                        and defensive techniques to outmaneuver their opponents. Beyond its physical demands, boxing is
                        also
                        a mental game, requiring concentration, discipline, and the ability to stay calm under pressure.
                        Regular training enhances cardiovascular health, builds muscle, and increases coordination.
                        Boxing
                        also promotes self-confidence, mental toughness, and resilience. Whether as a competitive sport
                        or a
                        fitness routine, boxing provides a full-body workout while instilling valuable life skills like
                        perseverance and determination. </p>
